I have added the functionality to insert documents on the "Tasks" page within the Project Detail View (`/projects/[id]`).

Specifically, for each task listed in the "Tasks" tab, you will now see:
*   A section displaying documents already associated with that task, powered by `DocumentsList.tsx`.
*   An option to upload new documents directly to that specific task, if you have the necessary `documents.create` permission.

This enhancement allows for seamless document management directly within the context of each task.

Please test this new functionality.
