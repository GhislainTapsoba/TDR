I have addressed the issue where you couldn't choose a manager in the project modification modal.

The problem was in `web-frontend/components/ProjectEditModal.tsx`, specifically how the list of users (managers) was being loaded. The `usersApi.getAll()` call's response was not being handled correctly, leading to an empty list of managers in the dropdown.

I have corrected the `loadUsers` function to properly destructure the `data` from the API response:
```typescript
const { data: usersData } = await usersApi.getAll();
const managers = usersData.filter((u: User) => u.role === 'MANAGER');
setUsers(managers);
```
I also added a `toast.error` message to provide feedback if managers fail to load.

This change should ensure that the manager dropdown is correctly populated with available managers. Please rebuild your frontend and test the project modification modal again.
